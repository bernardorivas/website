This presentation introduces a computational framework for analyzing the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks. The talk discusses how mathematical models and computational tools can be used to understand the complex behavior of gene regulatory systems, with a focus on rigorous methods for identifying global dynamics. The framework combines combinatorial, topological, and analytical approaches to provide insights into the behavior of biological systems.
