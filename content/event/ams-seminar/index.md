This seminar explores the intersection of combinatorics, topology, and homology in the study of network dynamics. The presentation demonstrates how these mathematical frameworks can be combined to analyze complex networks, with applications to biological systems and gene regulatory networks. The talk highlights recent advances in using algebraic topological methods to understand the global behavior of dynamical systems.
