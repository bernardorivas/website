#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Bernardo Rivas is a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics at the University of Toledo. His research focuses on the rigorous study of nonlinear dynamical systems, with a particular interest in hybrid systems and gene regulatory networks. He develops combinatorial and topological frameworks grounded in Conley Index Theory, and designs algorithms to rigorously identify global dynamics in complex models.
