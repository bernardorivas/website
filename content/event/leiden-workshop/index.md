This workshop presentation introduces combinatorial topological methods for analyzing gene regulatory networks. The talk explores how these mathematical frameworks can be used to understand the complex dynamics of high-dimensional biological networks. The presentation focuses on rigorous computational approaches that combine combinatorial and topological techniques to identify global dynamics in gene regulatory systems.
