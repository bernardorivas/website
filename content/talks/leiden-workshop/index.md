This workshop presentation introduced a combinatorial topological method for analyzing gene regulatory networks. The talk explored how these mathematical frameworks can be used to understand the complex dynamics of high-dimensional biological networks. The presentation focused on obtaining rigorous analytical bounds to identify dynamical structures.
