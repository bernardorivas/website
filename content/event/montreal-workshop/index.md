This workshop presentation discusses analytical bounds for combinatorial topological dynamics, focusing on rigorous mathematical frameworks for understanding nonlinear dynamical systems. The talk explores how analytical techniques can be combined with combinatorial and topological methods to provide rigorous bounds on the behavior of complex systems, with applications to gene regulatory networks and other biological systems.
