  #       My research focuses on the rigorous study of nonlinear dynamical systems, with applications to robotics, machine learning, systems biology and gene regulatory networks. I develop combinatorial and topological frameworks grounded in Conley Index Theory to analyze complex dynamical systems.

  #       I design algorithms to rigorously identify global dynamics in complex models, particularly focusing on:
  #       - Computational topology for dynamical systems
  #       - Combinatorial methods for gene regulatory networks
  #       - Rigorous numerics of invariant manifolds
        
  #       I'm interested in collaborations at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and biology. Feel free to reach out!
